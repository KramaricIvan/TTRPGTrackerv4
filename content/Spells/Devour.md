2nd level spell

_**Devour.**_ Concentration. Action. Take a big bite and swallow one medium or smaller creature that your are grappling, or any medium or smaller creature that is stunned, incapacitate or restrained. If the attack hits, the target is swallowed, and the grapple ends. The swallowed target is [blinded](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Blinded) and [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained), it has total cover against attacks and other effects outside your gut, and it takes 1d6 acid damage plus 2d6 bludgeoning damage at the start of each of your turns. You can have only one target swallowed at a time.

If you die or lose concentration, a swallowed creature is no longer [restrained](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Restrained) by you and can escape from your mouth using 5 feet of movement, exiting [prone](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Prone).
