# Logs:   

- [[Njumpka]] and [[Poppy]] the pop arrived at the front gates of the [[Rosenwald estate]].  
- They stumbled upon a trail of glowing pumpkins; after breaking one, they met [[Wisb]].  
- [[Wisb]] got intimidated by [[Poppy]] and called for reinforcements.

- During a battle with some Boggles and Whisps, they spotted a girl and two ghosts rushing towards them.  
![[Pasted image 20241029230158.png|center|300]]
- The girl was attacking them—ghosts and boggles—until, at the end, it was only ghost hunters and her standing.  
- That girl was [[Cthula]]. She entered a psychic conversation with both [[Njumpka]] and [[Poppy]].  
- After sharing their reasoning for visiting the estate at 3 am, they together headed towards the front door.  
---
- They were met with a large door with four keyholes, one key inside, and dozens of keys all around them. It took them a while, but they cracked the puzzle.  
- They entered the hall on the ground floor and noticed that some of the floor planks looked much better than the others. They found the [[Rosenwald siblings letter]].  
- After jumping on those planks again and hearing the clinking and clacking, they got bored and went to the first doors to their right.  
---
- There they were met with two cabinet tables, some [[images of the Rosenwald family]], and a wall of spider webs.  
- [[Poppy]] rushed through the web and discovered a little library decorated with a faint blue glow.  
- [[Cthula]] saw no issues with it and just walked in to grab a book. As she immersed her face in the book, a powerful cry reverberated throughout the estate corridors.  
- The banshee's wail caused [[Cthula]] and [[Poppy]] to faint. [[Njumpka]] was stuck between a spectral monster and a mimic who pretended to be the cabinet behind her.

- [[Poppy]] was in luck as his woodland vigor brought him back to life, and he in turn brought [[Cthula]] back.  
- After defeating the Banshee, the mimic party decided to take a nap.  
- Night went peacefully, and they discovered more [[Rosenwald siblings letter|letters between siblings]], [[a book, and some tarot cards]].

---
- They went to the corridors opposite the library and found themselves in a room with two cabinets, a spider web wall, some paintings of flowers, and a chest.  
![[Pasted image 20241029234458.png|center|700]]
- This time there were no mimics, and they cleared the web, only to find a pile of dead bodies, blood, and flies.   
- They had some issues opening the chest, and after some time they angered the spirit inside, who just flew away.   
- While they were playing with the endless looping chest, they noticed that the pile of cadavers was moving slightly, as if it were breathing.  
- When they attempted to remove the first few bodies, two Flesh Golems charged at them.

- [[Cthula]] wanted to have none of it, and [[Dimension Door|Dimension doored]] everyone out to the main hall.

# Char moments:

- [[Njumpka]] was unable to open an unlocked fence; she pushed it forcefully, only to be struck by a powerful backlash. She was just supposed to... pull  
- [[Njumpka]] climbs over [[Poppy]] to jump over the unlocked fence—the hard way, even though she has her [[Slippers of Spider Climbing]] equipped.  
- [[Njumpka]], the light-sensitive shadow goblin, rushed to grab a bright glowing pumpkin, then proceeded to get blinded and drop it, destroying it.  
- Pumpkin produced a scared little blue wisp that did nothing, but [[Poppy]] saw it as an opportunity to test his intimidation proficiency, and it worked. Petrified, [[Wisb]] called out to the surrounding fay to ward off the scary intruders.  
- Njumpka rushed to blast the Boggles by climbing the fence, only to set off 3 more wisps
- The fight with a few small boggles took hours, until [[Cthula]] became bored. She [[Evard's Black Tentacles|summoned eldritch tentacles]], which killed everyone (even [[Wisb]]) in 2 turns (compared to the 16 turns it took to kill one basic boggle).  
- The main door puzzle was nearly solved in the first five seconds, but after that, they made numerous mistakes and once again overlooked the possibility that some doors were simply unlocked.  
- [[Cthula]] is only standing at the mansion doors and letting her made hand and [[Poppy]] do all the exploration and all the dirty work of setting of traps.
- [[Cthula]] is checking blue glowing books in a haunted house just to get zeroed by a banshee. 
- The entire party took 362 turns to attempt to open a chest that kept revealing smaller chests within. They kept opening various chests with different sizes, shapes, and effects, including licking, inserting masks, and placing flowers inside. Despite these challenges, their curiosity never wavered. [[Cthula]] had a great idea to put a dead body into the chest, which just confused the spirit within. Spirit rushed out, and the party was left with nothing; just a broken worn out old chest
- [[Njumpka]] licked the never-ending chests, got poisoned, and then found it odd that she'd get poisoned from licking dead bodies in a shaking pile of dead bodies in a haunted house, to which she arrived to go exterminate powerful ghosts; she a mighty ghostslayer.  
- [[Cthula]] was not about to deal with Njumpkas fleshy dead kissing buddy and just teleported everyone the fuck away.
