# Letter1: 

Arunolt's letter sounds dreadfully serious. A "grand awakening" sounds rather ominous, doesn't it? Perhaps we should pay him a surprise visit at that school of his. I do miss his warmth and laughter.

Things at the academy remain frightfully dull, though I've taken to exploring the old east wing after hours. There's a peculiar locked room on the fifth floor that's piqued my curiosity. The matron nearly caught me the other night - I had to hide behind a rather grotesque statue of a bear for what felt like ages!

Keep your spirits up, dear brother. And do remember - in times of darkness, it's best to keep one's wits sharp and one's heart open.

With all my love, 
Kanae

P.S. I've enclosed a pressed flower from the academy gardens. Doesn't it look like it's winking at you

The mansion's halls seem to stretch endlessly without your laughter to fill them. Father's been spending more time in his workshop lately. The clanking of metal carries through the floorboards well into the night. This morning, I noticed new brass fittings on all the windows curious, isn't it?

Mother's been tending to her garden with unusual fervor. She's planted a new bed of night blooming flowers beneath the old oak. When I asked about them, she simply smiled and said, "They're for our nocturnal friends, dear." I didn't press further. 
---
I hope your studies are going well. The library misses your presence - I swear that one owlbear bookend looks forlorn without you there to straighten it every day. 
---
Write back soon, sister. The house feels... different without you.

Your brother,
